Gavin Andresen was the original lead developer of bitcoin-core after Satoshi went underground but he later took a role as the
"Chief Scientist" of bitcoin so that others could focus on developing bitcoin-core. This prevented Gavin from being a dictator
of bitcoin (benevolent or otherwise). Theymos managed the public relations side of bitcoin by running bitcointalk.org and 
moderating /r/bitcoin.
