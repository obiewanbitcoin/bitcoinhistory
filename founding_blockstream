Several of the post-Gavin bitcoin-core committers founded a company called Blockstream and accepted VC funding. Theymos 
(mod of /r/bitcoin and owner of bitcointalk.com) is not publicly affiliated with Blockstream, but the agenda on the forums he
moderates is closely aligned to their wishes. Blockstream claims no affiliation with Theymos, and has publicly discouraged 
censorship in these forums, but they continue to benefit from this censorship to this day.
