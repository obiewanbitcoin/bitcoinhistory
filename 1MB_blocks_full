Beginning December of 2015, many blocks were at or near the 1MB capacity. It was not uncommon to see 8-10 hour stretches of time with over 10,000 unconfirmed transactions. Though Blockstream Core had indicated a willingness to increase to a 2MB blocksize, this never materialized. Instead, they described unconfirmed transactions as dust, or the sender was blamed for choosing not to send enough of a fee for the transaction. This caused public frustration for casual users who simply wanted to use the network without engaging in politics.
